=============================================================================
Document structure                  *document-structure*

*html* (|head|, |body|)

  The namespace |URI| designates the document profile

Attributes:

  |i18n|
  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  xmlns       |URI|          #FIXED 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'

WCAG:

  |wcag3| Identify the primary natural language of a document.

=============================================================================
Document head                       *document-head*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*head.misc* "(|script| | |style| | |meta| | |link| | |object|)*"

  Content model is |head.misc| combined with a single
  title and an optional base element in any order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*head* (|head.misc|,
       ((|title|, |head.misc|, (|base|, |head.misc|)?) |
       (|base|, |head.misc|, (|title|, |head.misc|))))

Attributes:

  |i18n|
  |id|          ID             #IMPLIED
  profile       |URI|          #IMPLIED

The |head| element contains information about the current document, such as
its title, keywords that may be useful to search engines, and other data that
is not considered document content. User agents do not generally render
elements that appear in the |head| as content. They may, however, make
information in the HEAD available to users through other mechanisms.

{profile}
    This attribute specifies the location of one or more meta data profiles,
    separated by white space. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*title* (#PCDATA)

Attributes:

  |i18n|
  |id|          ID             #IMPLIED

WCAG:

  |wcag2| Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.

The |title| element is not considered part of the flow of text.  It should be
displayed, for example as the page header or window title. Exactly one |title|
is required per document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*base* EMPTY

  Document base URI.

Attributes:

  href        |URI|          #REQUIRED
  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  >
In XHTML, links and references to external images, applets, form-processing
programs, style sheets, etc. are always specified by a URI. Relative URIs are
resolved according to a base URI, which may come from a variety of sources.
The |base| element allows authors to specify a document's base URI explicitly.

When present, the |base| element must appear in the |head| section of an XHTML
document, before any element that refers to an external source. The path
information specified by the |base| element only affects URIs in the document
where the element appears.

{href}
    This attribute specifies an absolute URI that acts as the base URI for
    resolving relative URIs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*meta* EMPTY

  Generic metainformation.

Attributes:

  |i18n|
  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  http-equiv  CDATA          #IMPLIED
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED
  content     CDATA          #REQUIRED
  scheme      CDATA          #IMPLIED

WCAG:

  |wcag2| Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.
  |wcag2| Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not
          create periodically auto-refreshing pages.
  |wcag2| Until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not
	  use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the
	  server to perform redirects.

The |meta| element can be used to identify properties of a document (e.g.,
author, expiration date, a list of key words, etc.) and assign values to those
properties. This specification does not define a normative set of properties.

{http-equiv}
    HTTP servers use this attribute to gather information for HTTP response
    message headers.
{name}
    This attribute identifies a property name.
{content}
    This attribute specifies a property's value.
{scheme}
    This attribute names a scheme to be used to interpret the property's
    value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*link* EMPTY

  Relationship values.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  |charset|   |Charset|      #IMPLIED
  |href|      |URI|          #IMPLIED
  |hreflang|  |LanguageCode| #IMPLIED
  |type|      |ContentType|  #IMPLIED
  |rel|       |LinkTypes|    #IMPLIED
  |rev|       |LinkTypes|    #IMPLIED
  |media|     |MediaDesc|    #IMPLIED
 
WCAG:

  |wcag2| Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.
  |wcag2| Ensure that dynamic content is accessible or provide an alternative
          presentation or page.
  |wcag3| Provide information about document collections (i.e., documents
          comprising multiple pages - |rel|, |rev|).

Relationship values can be used in principle:

a) for document specific toolbars/menus when used with the link element in
   document head e.g.  start, contents, previous, next, index, end, help
b) to link to a separate style sheet (rel="stylesheet")
c) to make a link to a script (rel="script")
d) by stylesheets to control how collections of html nodes are rendered into
   printed documents
e) to make a link to a printable version of this document e.g. a PostScript or
   PDF version (rel="alternate" media="print")

*media*
    This attribute specifies the intended destination medium for style
    information. It may be a single media descriptor or a comma-separated
    list. The default value for this attribute is "screen".
                                                   *media-descriptors*
    screen - Intended for non-paged computer screens. 
    tty    - Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, such as
	     teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display
	     capabilities. 
    tv     - Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited
             scrollability). 
    projection - Intended for projectors. 
    handheld - Intended for handheld devices (small screen, monochrome, bitmapped
             graphics, limited bandwidth). 
    print  - Intended for paged, opaque material and for documents viewed on
             screen in print preview mode. 
    braille - Intended for braille tactile feedback devices. 
    aural  - Intended for speech synthesizers. 
    all    - Suitable for all devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*style* (#PCDATA)

  Style info, which may include CDATA sections.

Attributes:

  |i18n|
  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  type        |ContentType|  #REQUIRED
  |media|     |MediaDesc|    #IMPLIED
  title       |Text|         #IMPLIED (|title-attr|)
  xml:space   (preserve)     #FIXED 'preserve'

WCAG:

  |wcag1| Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets. For
	  example, when an HTML document is rendered without associated style
	  sheets, it must still be possible to read the document.
  |wcag1| Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available
          without color, for example from context or markup.
  |wcag2| Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.
  |wcag2| Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide
	  sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or
	  when viewed on a black and white screen.

The |style| element allows authors to put style sheet rules in the head of the
document. XHTML permits any number of  |style| elements in the |head| section
of a document.

{type}
    This attribute specifies the style sheet language of the element's
    contents and overrides the default style sheet language. The style sheet
    language is specified as a content type (e.g., "text/css"). Authors must
    supply a value for this attribute; there is no default value for this
    attribute.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*script* (#PCDATA)

  Script statements, which may include CDATA sections

Attributes:

  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  |charset|   |Charset|      #IMPLIED
  type        |ContentType|  #REQUIRED
  src         |URI|          #IMPLIED
  |defer|     (defer)        #IMPLIED
  xml:space   (preserve)     #FIXED 'preserve'

WCAG:

  |wcag1| Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other
	  programmatic objects are turned off or not supported (eg.
	  |noscript|). If this is not possible, provide equivalent information
	  on an alternative accessible page.
  |wcag1| Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid causing
          the screen to flicker.
  |wcag1| Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when the
          dynamic content changes.
  |wcag2| For scripts and applets, ensure that event handlers are input
          device-independent.
  |wcag2| For scripts, specify logical event handlers rather than
          device-dependent event handlers.
  |wcag2| Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid
          movement in pages.
  |wcag2| Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly
          accessible or compatible with assistive technologies.
  |wcag2| Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not
          create periodically auto-refreshing pages.
  |wcag2| Until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not
	  use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the
	  server to perform redirects.

The script may be defined within the contents of the  SCRIPT element or in an
external file. If the src attribute is not set, user agents must interpret the
contents of the element as the script.

{type}
    This attribute specifies the scripting language of the element's contents
    and overrides the default scripting language. The scripting language is
    specified as a content type (e.g., "text/javascript"). Authors must supply
    a value for this attribute. There is no default value for this attribute.
{src}
    This attribute specifies the location of an external script.
*defer*
    When set, this boolean attribute provides a hint to the user agent that
    the script is not going to generate any document content (e.g., no
    "document.write" in javascript) and thus, the user agent can continue
    parsing and rendering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*noscript* (|block| | |form| | |misc|)*

  Alternate content container for non script-based rendering

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  >
The |noscript| element allows authors to provide alternate content when
a script is not executed. The content of a |noscript| element should only be
rendered by a script-aware user agent in the following cases: 

- The user agent is configured not to evaluate scripts.
- The user agent doesn't support a scripting language invoked by a |script|
  element earlier in the document.

User agents that do not support client-side scripts must render this element's
contents.

=============================================================================
Document body                       *document-body*

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*body* (|block| | |form| | |misc|)*

  The body of a document contains the document's content.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  |onload|        |Script|   #IMPLIED
  |onunload|      |Script|   #IMPLIED

*onload*
    The onload event occurs when the user agent finishes loading a window or
    all frames within a frameset.
*onunload*
    The onunload event occurs when the user agent removes a document from
    a window or frame.  >

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*div* (#PCDATA | |block| | |form| | |inline| | |misc|)*

  Generic language/style container.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|

The |div| and |span| elements, in conjunction with the id and  class
attributes, offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents. These
elements define content to be inline (|span|) or block-level (|div|) but
impose no other presentational idioms on the content. Thus, authors may use
these elements in conjunction with style sheets, the lang attribute, etc., to
tailor XHTML to their own needs and tastes.

=============================================================================
Paragraphs                          *paragraphs*

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*p* (#PCDATA | |inline| | |misc.inline|)*

  The |p| element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level
  elements (including |p| itself).

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|

WCAG:

  |wcag2| Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where
          natural and appropriate - break lines of text in paragraphs.
  |wcag3| Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,
          paragraphs, lists, etc.

=============================================================================
Headings                            *heading*

There are six levels of headings in XHTML with |h1| as the most important and
|h6| as the least. Visual browsers usually render more important headings in
larger fonts than less important ones.

A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces.
Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a
table of contents for a document automatically.

|wcag2| Use header elements to convey document structure and use them
        according to specification.
|wcag2| Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where
        natural and appropriate.
|wcag3| Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,
        paragraphs, lists, etc.

=============================================================================
Lists                               *lists*

Ordered and unordered lists are rendered in an identical manner except that
visual user agents number ordered list items. User agents may present those
numbers in a variety of ways. Unordered list items are not numbered.

Definition lists                    *definition-lists*

Definition lists vary only slightly from other types of lists in that list
items consist of two parts: a term and a description. The term is given by the
|dt| element and is restricted to inline content. The description is given
with a |dd| element that contains block-level content.

The |pre| element tells visual user agents that the enclosed text is
"preformatted". When handling preformatted text, visual user agents:

- May leave white space intact.
- May render text with a fixed-pitch font.
- May disable automatic word wrap.
- Must not disable bidirectional processing.

Non-visual user agents are not required to respect extra white space in the
content of a |pre| element.

          effects such as indentation. 

Visual user agents generally render |blockquote| as an indented block.

*cite-attr*
    The value of this attribute is a URI that designates a source document or
    message. This attribute is intended to give information about the source
    from which the quotation was borrowed.

Inserted/deleted text               *inserted-deleted-text*

|ins|/|del| are allowed in block and inline content, but its inappropriate to
include block content within an ins element occurring in inline content.

|ins| and |del| are used to markup sections of the document that have been
inserted or deleted with respect to a different version of a document (e.g.,
in draft legislation where lawmakers need to view the changes).

These two elements are unusual for HTML in that they may serve as either
block-level or inline elements (but not both). They may contain one or more
words within a paragraph or contain one or more block-level elements such as
paragraphs, lists and tables.

The |div| and |span| elements, in conjunction with the id and  class
attributes, offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents. These
elements define content to be inline (|span|) or block-level (|div|) but
impose no other presentational idioms on the content. Thus, authors may use
these elements in conjunction with style sheets, the lang attribute, etc., to
tailor HTML to their own needs and tastes.

Most user agents have built-in mechanisms for rendering common data types such
as text, GIF images, colors, fonts, and a handful of graphic elements. To
render data types they don't support natively, user agents generally run
external applications. The |object| element allows authors to control whether
data should be rendered externally or by some program, specified by the
author, that renders the data within the user agent.

*declare*
    When present, this boolean attribute makes the current object definition
    a declaration only. The object must be instantiated by a subsequent
    object definition referring to this declaration.
*classid*
    This attribute may be used to specify the location of an object's
    implementation via a URI. It may be used together with, or as an
    alternative to the  data attribute, depending on the type of object
    involved.
*codebase*
    This attribute specifies the base path used to resolve relative URIs
    specified by the classid, data, and  archive attributes. When absent, its
    default value is the base URI of the current document.
*data*
    This attribute may be used to specify the location of the object's data,
    for instance image data for objects defining images, or more generally,
    a serialized form of an object which can be used to recreate it. If given
    as a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the  codebase
    attribute.
{type}
    This attribute specifies the content type for the data specified by  data.
    This attribute is optional but recommended when data is specified since it
    allows the user agent to avoid loading information for unsupported content
    types. If the value of this attribute differs from the HTTP Content-Type
    returned by the server when the object is retrieved, the HTTP Content-Type
    takes precedence.
*codetype*
    This attribute specifies the content type of data expected when
    downloading the object specified by  classid. This attribute is optional
    but recommended when classid is specified since it allows the user agent
    to avoid loading information for unsupported content types. When absent,
    it defaults to the value of the type attribute. 
*archive*
    This attribute may be used to specify a space-separated list of URIs for
    archives containing resources relevant to the object, which may include
    the resources specified by the classid and data attributes. Preloading
    archives will generally result in reduced load times for objects. Archives
    specified as relative URIs should be interpreted relative to the codebase
    attribute.
*standby*
    This attribute specifies a message that a user agent may render while
    loading the object's implementation and data.
*usemap*
    This attribute associates an image map with an element. The image map is
    defined by a |map| element. The value of usemap must match the value of the
    name attribute of the associated |map| element.
    Usemap points to a map element which may be in this document
    or an external document, although the latter is not widely supported
{name}
    This attribute assigns the control name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*param* EMPTY

  |param| is used to supply a named property value.  In XML it would seem
  natural to follow RDF and support an abbreviated syntax where the param
  elements are replaced by attribute value pairs on the object start tag.

Attributes:

  |id|        ID             #IMPLIED
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED
  value       CDATA          #IMPLIED
  valuetype   (data | ref | object) "data"
  type        |ContentType|  #IMPLIED

{name}
    This attribute defines the name of a run-time parameter, assumed to be
    known by the inserted object. Whether the property name is case-sensitive
    depends on the specific object implementation.
{value}
    This attribute specifies the value of a run-time parameter specified by
    name. Property values have no meaning to XHTML; their meaning is determined
    by the object in question.
{valuetype}
    This attribute specifies the type of the value attribute. Possible values: 
    - data: This is default value for the attribute. It means that the value
      specified by value will be evaluated and passed to the object's
      implementation as a string.
    - ref: The value specified by value is a URI that designates a resource
      where run-time values are stored. This allows support tools to identify
      URIs given as parameters. The URI must be passed to the object as is,
      i.e., unresolved.
    - object: The value specified by  value is an identifier that refers to an
      |object| declaration in the same document. The identifier must be the
      value of the id attribute set for the declared |object| element.
{type}
    This attribute specifies the content type of the resource designated by
    the value attribute only in the case where  valuetype is set to "ref".
    This attribute thus specifies for the user agent, the type of values that
    will be found at the URI designated by value.

Images                              *images*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*img* EMPTY

  To avoid accessibility problems for people who aren't able to see the image,
  you should provide a text description using the alt and longdesc attributes.
  In addition, avoid the use of server-side image maps.  
  Note that in Strict there is no name attribute. That is only available in
  the transitional and frameset.

    specified by the lang attribute.
*longdesc*
    This attribute specifies a link to a long description of the image. This
    description should supplement the short description provided using the
    |alt| attribute. When the image has an associated image map, this
    attribute should provide information about the image map's contents. This
    is particularly important for server-side image maps. Since an |img|
    element may be within the content of an |a| element, the user agent's
    mechanism in the user interface for accessing the |longdesc| resource of
    the former must be different than the mechanism for accessing the |href|
    resource of the latter.
*height*
    Image and object height override.
*width*
    Image and object width override.
*ismap*
    Server-side map.

*shape*
    This attribute specifies the shape of a region. Possible values: 
    - default: Specifies the entire region.
    - rect: Define a rectangular region.
    - circle: Define a circular region.
    - poly: Define a polygonal region.
*coord*
    This attribute specifies the position and shape on the screen. The number
    and order of values depends on the shape being defined. Possible
    combinations: 
    - rect: left-x, top-y, right-x, bottom-y.
    - circle: center-x, center-y, radius. Note. When the radius value is
      a percentage value, user agents should calculate the final radius value
      based on the associated object's width and height. The radius should be
      the smaller value of the two.
    - poly: x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xN, yN. The first x and y coordinate pair and
      the last should be the same to close the polygon. When these coordinate
      values are not the same, user agents should infer an additional
      coordinate pair to close the polygon.
    Coordinates are relative to the top, left corner of the object. All values
    are lengths. All values are separated by commas.
*nohref*
    When set, this boolean attribute specifies that a region has no associated
    link.

  |wcag3| Create a logical tab order through form controls.
  |wcag3| Provide keyboard shortcuts to important form controls, and groups of
          form controls.

*action*
    This attribute specifies a form processing agent. User agent behavior for
    a value other than an HTTP URI is undefined.
*method*
    This attribute specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit the form
    data set. Possible (case-insensitive) values are "get" (the default) and
    "post". See the section on  form submission for usage information.
*enctype*
    This attribute specifies the content type used to submit the form to the
    server (when the value of method is "post"). The default value for this
    attribute is  "application-www-form-urlencoded". The value
    "multipart/form-data" should be used in combination with the  INPUT
    element, type="file". 
*onsubmit*
    The onsubmit event occurs when a form is submitted.
*onreset*
    The onreset event occurs when a form is reset.
*accept*
    This attribute specifies a comma-separated list of content types that
    a server processing this form will handle correctly. User agents may use
    this information to filter out non-conforming files when prompting a user
    to select files to be sent to the server (cf. the |input| element when
    type="file").
*accept-charset*
    This attribute specifies the list of character encodings for input data
    that is accepted by the server processing this form. The value is a space-
    andr comma-delimited list of charset values. The client must interpret
    this list as an exclusive-or list, i.e., the server is able to accept any
    single character encoding per entity received. 
    The default value for this attribute is the reserved string "UNKNOWN".
    User agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was
    used to transmit the document containing this |form| element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*label* (#PCDATA | |inline| | |misc.inline|)*

  The |label| element may be used to attach information to controls. Each
  |label| element is associated with exactly one form control.  Each label
  must not contain more than ONE field.  Label elements shouldn't be nested.

Attributes:

WCAG:

  |wcag2| Associate labels explicitly with their controls (|for|).
  |wcag2| Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and
	  form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated
	  labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.
  |wcag3| Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
	  client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls
	  (|accesskey|).

*for*
    This attribute explicitly associates the label being defined with another
    control. When present, the value of this attribute must be the same as the
    value of the id attribute of some other control in the same document. When
    absent, the label being defined is associated with the element's contents.

	  (|accesskey|).
  |wcag3| Include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text
          areas.

{type}
    This attribute specifies the type of control to create. The default value
    for this attribute is "text". 
{name}
    This attribute assigns the control name. 
{value}
    This attribute specifies the initial value of the control. It is optional
    except when the  type attribute has the value "radio" or "checkbox".
{size}
    This attribute tells the user agent the initial width of the control. The
    width is given in pixels except when  type attribute has the value "text"
    or "password". In that case, its value refers to the (integer) number of
    characters.
{maxlength}
    When the type attribute has the value "text" or "password", this attribute
    specifies the maximum number of characters the user may enter. This number
    may exceed the specified size, in which case the user agent should offer
    a scrolling mechanism. The default value for this attribute is an
    unlimited number.
{checked}
    When the type attribute has the value "radio" or "checkbox", this boolean
    attribute specifies that the button is on. User agents must ignore this
    attribute for other control types.
{src}
    When the type attribute has the value "image", this attribute specifies
    the location of the image to be used to decorate the graphical submit
    button.
{readonly}
    When set for a form control, this boolean attribute prohibits changes to
    the control.
*disabled*
    When set for a form control, this boolean attribute disables the control
    for user input.
*onselect*
    The onselect event occurs when a user selects some text in a text field.
*onchange*
    The onchange event occurs when a control loses the input focus and its
    value has been modified since gaining focus. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*InputType* (|input-text| | |password| | |checkbox| |
             |radio| | |submit| | |reset| |
             |input-file| | |hidden| | |input-image| | |input-button|)

  The name attribute is required for all but submit & reset

*input-text*
    Creates a single-line text input control. 
*password*
    Like "text", but the input text is rendered in such a way as to hide the
    characters (e.g., a series of asterisks). This control type is often used
    for sensitive input such as passwords. Note that the current value is the
    text entered by the user, not the text rendered by the user agent. 

    Note: This mechanism affords only light security protection. Although the
    password is masked by user agents from casual observers, it is transmitted
    to the server in clear text, and may be read by anyone with low-level
    access to the network.
*checkbox*
    Creates a checkbox. 
*radio*
    Creates a radio button. 
*submit*
    Creates a submit button. 
*input-image*
    Creates a graphical submit button. The value of the  src attribute
    specifies the |URI| of the image that will decorate the button. For
    accessibility reasons, authors should provide alternate text for the image
    via the alt attribute. 

    When a pointing device is used to click on the image, the form is
    submitted and the click coordinates passed to the server. The x value is
    measured in pixels from the left of the image, and the y value in pixels
    from the top of the image. The submitted data includes name.x=x-value and
    name.y=y-value where "name" is the value of the name attribute, and
    x-value and y-value are the x and y coordinate values, respectively.

    If the server takes different actions depending on the location clicked,
    users of non-graphical browsers will be disadvantaged. For this reason,
    authors should consider alternate approaches:

    - Use multiple submit buttons (each with its own image) in place of a single
      graphical submit button. Authors may use style sheets to control the
      positioning of these buttons.
    - Use a client-side image map together with scripting.
*reset*
    Creates a reset button. 
*input-button*
    Creates a push button. User agents should use the value of the value
    attribute as the button's label. 
*hidden*
    Creates a hidden control. 
*input-file*
    Creates a file select control. User agents may use the value of the value
    attribute as the initial file name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*select* (|optgroup| | |option|)+

  Option selector.

          natural and appropriate (|optgroup|).
  |wcag3| Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and
          objects (|tabindex|). 

The |select| element creates a menu. Each choice offered by the menu is
represented by an |option| element. A |select| element must contain at least
one |option| element.

{name}
    This attribute assigns the control name.
{size}
    If a |select| element is presented as a scrolled list box, this attribute
    specifies the number of rows in the list that should be visible at the
    same time. Visual user agents are not required to present a |select|
    element as a list box; they may use any other mechanism, such as
    a drop-down menu.
{multiple}
    If set, this boolean attribute allows multiple selections. If not set, the
    |select| element only permits single selections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*optgroup* (|option|)+

  Option group.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  |disabled|  (disabled)     #IMPLIED
  label       |Text|         #REQUIRED

The |optgroup| element allows authors to group choices logically. This is
particularly helpful when the user must choose from a long list of options;
groups of related choices are easier to grasp and remember than a single long
list of options. 

{label}
    This attribute specifies the label for the option group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*option* (#PCDATA)

  Selectable choice.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  selected    (selected)     #IMPLIED
  |disabled|  (disabled)     #IMPLIED
  label       |Text|         #IMPLIED
  value       CDATA          #IMPLIED

When rendering a menu choice, user agents should use the value of the label
attribute of the |option| element as the choice. If this attribute is not
specified, user agents should use the contents of the |option| element.

{selected}
    When set, this boolean attribute specifies that this option is
    pre-selected.
{value}
    This attribute specifies the initial value of the control. If this
    attribute is not set, the initial value is set to the contents of the
    |option| element.
{label}
    This attribute allows authors to specify a shorter label for an option
    than the content of the |option| element. When specified, user agents
    should use the value of this attribute rather than the content of the
    |option| element as the option label.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  (|accesskey|).
  |wcag3| Include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text
          areas.

The |textarea| element creates a  multi-line text input control. User agents
should use the contents of this element as the initial value of the control
and should render this text initially.

{name}
    This attribute assigns the control name.
{rows}
    This attribute specifies the number of visible text lines. Users should be
    able to enter more lines than this, so user agents should provide some
    means to scroll through the contents of the control when the contents
    extend beyond the visible area. 
{cols}
    This attribute specifies the visible width in average character widths.
    Users should be able to enter longer lines than this, so user agents
    should provide some means to scroll through the contents of the control
    when the contents extend beyond the visible area. User agents may wrap
    visible text lines to keep long lines visible without the need for
    scrolling.
*readonly*
    When set for a form control, this boolean attribute prohibits changes to
    the control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*fieldset* (#PCDATA | |legend| | |block| | |form| | |inline| | |misc|)*

  The fieldset element is used to group form fields.  Only one legend element
  should occur in the content and if present should only be preceded by
  whitespace.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|

WCAG:

  |wcag2| Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where
          natural and appropriate (|fieldset|, |legend|)

The |fieldset| element allows authors to group thematically related controls
and labels. Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand their
purpose while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user
agents and speech navigation for speech-oriented user agents. The proper use
of this element makes documents more accessible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*legend* |Inline|

  Fieldset label.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|

WCAG:

  |wcag3| Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
	  client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls
	  (|accesskey|).

The |legend| element allows authors to assign a caption to a  |fieldset.| The
legend improves accessibility when the  |fieldset| is rendered non-visually.

  |wcag3| Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
	  client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls
	  (|accesskey|).

Buttons created with the  |button| element function just like buttons created
with the |input| element, but they offer richer rendering possibilities: the
|button| element may have content. For example, a |button| element that
contains an image functions like and may resemble an |input| element whose
type is set to "image", but the |button| element type allows content.

{name}
    This attribute assigns the control name.
{value}
    This attribute specifies the initial value of the control.
{type}
    This attribute declares the type of the button. Possible values: 
    - submit: Creates a submit button. This is the default value.
    - reset: Creates a reset button.
    - button: Creates a push button

=============================================================================
Tables                              *tables*

Derived from IETF HTML table standard, see [RFC1942]

*TFrame* "(void | above | below | hsides | lhs | rhs | vsides | box | border)"

  The border attribute sets the thickness of the frame around the table. The
  default units are screen pixels.
  
  The frame attribute specifies which parts of the frame around the table
  should be rendered. The values are not the same as CALS to avoid a name
  clash with the valign attribute.  The rules attribute defines which rules to
  draw between cells:

*TRules* "(none | groups | rows | cols | all)"

  If rules is absent then assume:
  "none" if border is absent or border="0" otherwise "all"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*table* 
  (|caption|?, (|col|* | |colgroup|*), |thead|?, |tfoot|?, (|tbody|+ | |tr|+))

  The |table| element contains all other elements that specify caption, rows,
  content, and formatting.

  |wcag1| For data tables, identify row and column headers (|th|)
  |wcag1| For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
          column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.
  |wcag2| Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when
	  linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an
	  alternative equivalent.
  |wcag2| Identify structural groups of rows (|thead| for repeated table

  |wcag2| If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for
          the purpose of visual formatting.
  |wcag2| Describe table with |caption|.
  |wcag2| Describe table with "title" attribute.
  |wcag3| Provide "summary" attribute.

{summary}
    This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for
    user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille.
{width}
    This attribute specifies the desired width of the entire table and is
    intended for visual user agents. When the value is a percentage value, the
    value is relative to the user agent's available horizontal space. In the
    absence of any width specification, table width is determined by the user
    agent.
{border}
    This attributes specifies the width (in pixels only) of the frame around
    a table.
{frame}
    This attribute specifies which sides of the frame surrounding a table will
    be visible. Possible values: 
    - void: No sides. This is the default value.
    - above: The top side only.
    - below: The bottom side only.
    - hsides: The top and bottom sides only.
    - vsides: The right and left sides only.
    - lhs: The left-hand side only.
    - rhs: The right-hand side only.
    - box: All four sides.
    - border: All four sides.
{rules} 
    This attribute specifies which rules will appear between cells within
    a table. The rendering of rules is user agent dependent. Possible values: 
    - none: No rules. This is the default value.
    - groups: Rules will appear between row groups (see |thead|, |tfoot|, and
      |tbody|) and column groups (see |colgroup| and |col|) only.
    - rows: Rules will appear between rows only.
    - cols: Rules will appear between columns only.
    - all: Rules will appear between all rows and columns.
{cellspacing}
    This attribute specifies how much space the user agent should leave
    between the left side of the table and the left-hand side of the leftmost
    column, the top of the table and the top side of the topmost row, and so
    on for the right and bottom of the table. The attribute also specifies the
    amount of space to leave between cells. 
{cellpadding}
    This attribute specifies the amount of space between the border of the
    cell and its contents. If the value of this attribute is a pixel length,
    all four margins should be this distance from the contents. If the value
    of the attribute is a percentage length, the top and bottom margins should
    be equally separated from the content based on a percentage of the
    available vertical space, and the left and right margins should be equally
    separated from the content based on a percentage of the available
    horizontal space.

*caption* (#PCDATA | |inline| | |misc.inline|)*

  When present, the |caption| element's text should describe the nature of the
  table. The |caption| element is only permitted immediately after the |table|
  start tag. A |table| element may only contain one  |caption| element.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*colgroup* (|col|)*

  Colgroup groups a set of col elements. It allows you to group
  several semantically related columns together.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|
  |events|
  span        |Number|       "1"
  width       |MultiLength|  #IMPLIED

  |char|      |Character|    #IMPLIED   [alignment char]
  |charoff|   |Length|       #IMPLIED   [offset for alignment char]
  |valign|    (top | middle | bottom | baseline) #IMPLIED

WCAG:

  |wcag1| For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
	  column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.

The |colgroup| element creates an explicit column group. The number of
columns in the column group may be specified in two, mutually exclusive
ways:

- The element's span attribute (default value 1) specifies the number of
  columns in the group.
- Each  |col| element in the |colgroup| represents one or more columns in the
  group.

{span}
    This attribute, which must be an integer > 0, specifies the number of
    columns in a column group. Values mean the following: 
    
    - In the absence of a span attribute, each |colgroup| defines a column
      group containing one column.
    - If the span attribute is set to N > 0, the current |colgroup| element
      defines a column group containing N columns.

    User agents must ignore this attribute if the |colgroup| element contains
    one or more |col| elements.
{width}
    This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current
    column group. In addition to the standard pixel, percentage, and relative
    values, this attribute allows the special form "0*" (zero asterisk) which
    means that the width of the each column in the group should be the minimum
    width necessary to hold the column's contents. This implies that
    a column's entire contents must be known before its width may be correctly
    computed. Authors should be aware that specifying "0*" will prevent visual
    user agents from rendering a table incrementally.
    This attribute is overridden for any column in the column group whose
    width is specified via a |col| element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*col* EMPTY

  |col| elements define the alignment properties for cells in one or more
  columns.

  The width attribute specifies the width of the columns, e.g.

     width=64        width in screen pixels
     width=0.5*      relative width of 0.5

  The span attribute causes the attributes of one col element to apply to more
  than one column.

Attributes:

  |coreattrs|
  |i18n|

  span        |Number|       "1"
  width       |MultiLength|  #IMPLIED

  |char|      |Character|    #IMPLIED   [alignment char]
  |charoff|   |Length|       #IMPLIED   [offset for alignment char]
  |valign|    (top | middle | bottom | baseline) #IMPLIED

WCAG:

  |wcag1| For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
          column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.

The |col| element allows authors to group together attribute specifications
for table columns. The |col| does not group columns together structurally --
that is the role of the  |colgroup| element.  |col| elements are empty and
serve only as a support for attributes. They may appear inside or outside an
explicit column group (i.e., |colgroup| element).

{span}
    This attribute, whose value must be an integer > 0, specifies the number
    of columns "spanned" by the |col| element; the |col| element shares its
    attributes with all the columns it spans. The default value for this
    attribute is 1 (i.e., the  |col| element refers to a single column). If the
    span attribute is set to N > 1, the current |col| element shares its
    attributes with the next N-1 columns.
{width}
    This attribute specifies a default width for each column spanned by the
    current  |col| element. It has the same meaning as the  width attribute for
    the |colgroup| element and overrides it.
*align-attr*
    This attribute specifies the alignment of data and the justification of
    text in a cell. Possibly values:
    - left: Left-flush dataeft-justify text. This is the default value for
      table data.
    - center: Center dataenter-justify text. This is the default value for
      table headers.
    - right: Right-flush data/Right-justify text.
    - justify: Double-justify text.
    - char: Align text around a specific character. If a user agent doesn't
      support character alignment, behavior in the presence of this value is
      unspecified.
*char*
    This attribute specifies a single character within a text fragment to act
    as an axis for alignment. The default value for this attribute is the
    decimal point character for the current language as set by the lang
    attribute (e.g., the period (".") in English and the comma (",") in
    French). User agents are not required to support this attribute.
*charoff*
    When present, this attribute specifies the offset to the first occurrence
    of the alignment character on each line. If a line doesn't include the
    alignment character, it should be horizontally shifted to end at the
    alignment position. 
    When  charoff is used to set the offset of an alignment character, the
    direction of offset is determined by the current text direction (set by
    the dir attribute). In left-to-right texts (the default), offset is from
    the left margin. In right-to-left texts, offset is from the right margin.
    User agents are not required to support this attribute.
*valign*
    This attribute specifies the vertical position of data within a cell.
    Possible values: 
    - top: Cell data is flush with the top of the cell.
      middle: Cell data is centered vertically within the cell. This is the
      default value.
    - bottom: Cell data is flush with the bottom of the cell.
    - baseline: All cells in the same row as a cell whose  valign attribute
      has this value should have their textual data positioned so that the
      first text line occurs on a baseline common to all cells in the row.
      This constraint does not apply to subsequent text lines in these cells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*thead*    (|tr|)+
*tfoot*    (|tr|)+
*tbody*    (|tr|)+
*tr*       (|th| | |td|)+

  Use |thead| to duplicate headers when breaking table across page boundaries,
  or for static headers when tbody sections are rendered in scrolling panel.
  
  Use |tfoot| to duplicate footers when breaking table across page boundaries,
  or for static footers when tbody sections are rendered in scrolling panel.
  
  Use multiple |tbody| sections when rules are needed between groups of table
  rows.

  |charoff|   |Length|       #IMPLIED   [offset for alignment char]
  |valign|    (top | middle | bottom | baseline) #IMPLIED

WCAG:

  |wcag1| For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
          column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.

Table rows may be grouped into a table head, table foot, and one or more table
body sections, using the |thead|,  |tfoot| and |tbody| elements, respectively.
This division enables user agents to support scrolling of table bodies
independently of the table head and foot. When long tables are printed, the
table head and foot information may be repeated on each page that contains
table data.

The table head and table foot should contain information about the table's
columns. The table body should contain rows of table data.

When present, each |thead|, |tfoot|, and |tbody| contains a row group. Each
row group must contain at least one row, defined by the |tr| element.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*th* (#PCDATA | |block| | |form| | |inline| | |misc|)*
*td* (#PCDATA | |block| | |form| | |inline| | |misc|)*

WCAG:

  |wcag1| For data tables, identify row and column headers.
  |wcag2| Label table elements with the |scope|, |headers|, and |axis|
	  attributes so that future browsers and assistive technologies will
	  be able to select data from a table by filtering on categories.
  |wcag3| Provide abbreviations for header labels (|abbr-attr|).

Table cells may contain two types of information: header information and data.
This distinction enables user agents to render header and data cells
distinctly, even in the absence of style sheets. For example, visual user
agents may present header cell text with a bold font. Speech synthesizers may
render header information with a distinct voice inflection.

The TH element defines a cell that contains header information. User agents
have two pieces of header information available: the contents of the |th|
element and the value of the  abbr attribute. User agents must render either
the contents of the cell or the value of the abbr attribute. For visual media,
the latter may be appropriate when there is insufficient space to render the
full contents of the cell. For non-visual media abbr may be used as an
abbreviation for table headers when these are rendered along with the contents
of the cells to which they apply.

The headers and scope attributes also allow authors to help non-visual user
agents process header information. Please consult the section on labeling
cells for non-visual user agents for information and examples.

The |td| element defines a cell that contains data.

Cells may be empty (i.e., contain no data).

*abbr-attr*
    This attribute should be used to provide an abbreviated form of the cell's
    content, and may be rendered by user agents when appropriate in place of
    the cell's content. Abbreviated names should be short since user agents
    may render them repeatedly. For instance, speech synthesizers may render
    the abbreviated headers relating to a particular cell before rendering
    that cell's content.
*axis*
    This attribute may be used to place a cell into conceptual categories that
    can be considered to form axes in an n-dimensional space. User agents may
    give users access to these categories (e.g., the user may query the user
    agent for all cells that belong to certain categories, the user agent may
    present a table in the form of a table of contents, etc.). Please consult
    the section on categorizing cells for more information. The value of this
    attribute is a comma-separated list of category names.
*headers*
    This attribute specifies the list of header cells that provide header
    information for the current data cell. The value of this attribute is
    a space-separated list of cell names; those cells must be named by setting
    their id attribute. Authors generally use the headers attribute to help
    non-visual user agents render header information about data cells (e.g.,
    header information is spoken prior to the cell data), but the attribute
    may also be used in conjunction with style sheets. See also the scope
    attribute. 
*scope*
    This attribute specifies the set of data cells for which the current
    header cell provides header information. This attribute may be used in
    place of the  headers attribute, particularly for simple tables. When
    specified, this attribute must have one of the following values: 
    - row: The current cell provides header information for the rest of the
      row that contains it (see also the section on table directionality).
    - col: The current cell provides header information for the rest of the
      column that contains it.
    - rowgroup: The header cell provides header information for the rest of
      the row group that contains it.
    - colgroup: The header cell provides header information for the rest of
      the column group that contains it.
*rowspan*
    This attribute specifies the number of rows spanned by the current cell.
    The default value of this attribute is one ("1"). The value zero ("0")
    means that the cell spans all rows from the current row to the last row of
    the table section (|thead|, |tbody|, or |tfoot|) in which the cell is
    defined.
*colspan*
    This attribute specifies the number of columns spanned by the current
    cell. The default value of this attribute is one ("1"). The value zero
    ("0") means that the cell spans all columns from the current column to the
    last column of the column group (|colgroup|) in which the cell is defined.

=============================================================================
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines *wcag*

WCAG is set of guidelines to make sure all people with various disabilities
will be able to understand content of web page.

Note: short notes in this document apply only to direct use of XHTML tags, not
use of CSS, composition of whole page or whole web site.

Guidelines:

 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.

	Provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially
	the same function or purpose as auditory or visual content.

 2. Don't rely on color alone.

	Ensure that text and graphics are understandable when viewed without
	color.

 3. Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.

	Mark up documents with the proper structural elements. Control
	presentation with style sheets rather than with presentation elements
	and attributes.
 
 4. Clarify natural language usage

	Use markup that facilitates pronunciation or interpretation of
	abbreviated or foreign text.

 5. Create tables that transform gracefully.

	Ensure that tables have necessary markup to be transformed by
	accessible browsers and other user agents.

 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully.

	Ensure that pages are accessible even when newer technologies are not
	supported or are turned off.

 7. Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes.

	Ensure that moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating objects or
	pages may be paused or stopped.

 8. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.

	Ensure that the user interface follows principles of accessible
	design: device-independent access to functionality, keyboard
	operability, self-voicing, etc.

 9. Design for device-independence.

	Use features that enable activation of page elements via a variety of
	input devices.

10. Use interim solutions.

	Use interim accessibility solutions so that assistive technologies and
	older browsers will operate correctly.

11. Use W3C technologies and guidelines.

	Use W3C technologies (according to specification) and follow
	accessibility guidelines. Where it is not possible to use a W3C
	technology, or doing so results in material that does not transform
	gracefully, provide an alternative version of the content that is
	accessible.

12. Provide context and orientation information.

	Provide context and orientation information to help users understand
	complex pages or elements.

13. Provide clear navigation mechanisms.

	Provide clear and consistent navigation mechanisms -- orientation
	information, navigation bars, a site map, etc. -- to increase the
	likelihood that a person will find what they are looking for at
	a site.

14. Ensure that documents are clear and simple.

	Ensure that documents are clear and simple so they may be more easily
	understood.

|wcag2| Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.
|wcag1| If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide
a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has
equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the
inaccessible (original) page.

Full description of guidelines is here (as for WCAG 1.0):

Solutions for HTML:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/ ~

Priorities:

*wcag1* Priority 1 (highest): A Web content developer MUST satisfy this
checkpoint. Otherwise, one or more groups will find it impossible to access
information in the document. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement
for some groups to be able to use Web documents.

*wcag2* Priority 2: A Web content developer should satisfy this checkpoint.
Otherwise, one or more groups will find it difficult to access information in
the document.  Satisfying this checkpoint will remove significant barriers to
accessing Web documents.

*wcag3* Priority 3: A Web content developer may address this checkpoint.
Otherwise, one or more groups will find it somewhat difficult to access
information in the document.  Satisfying this checkpoint will improve access
to Web documents.
